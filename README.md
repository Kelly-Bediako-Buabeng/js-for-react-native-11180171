# Task 1

 ## For task 1 I created a function that takes numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and odd number trippled when displayed.



# Task 2

 ## For task 2 I created a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new array where words in the string functions that match even numbers in  the numbers function are converted to uppercase and to lower case for odd numbers
